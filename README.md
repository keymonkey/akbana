A Knowledgebase and Not Aphpkb

Version:  Pre-beta, planning stage.

Primary Goal:  Build a web-based knowledgebase application in the style of aphpkb with the condition of not using PHP (not that there is anything wrong with that), nor using Andy's name and photo all over the place.

Secondary Goal:  Have lots of fun coding.

Tertiary Goal:  Learn new things
